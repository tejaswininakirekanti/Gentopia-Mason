Abstract
Transformer based language models (LMs)
demonstrate increasing performance with
scale across a wide variety of tasks. Scale
alone however cannot enable models to solve
tasks that require access to ephemeral, chang-
ing, or private data that was unavailable at
training time. Many useful tasks may also ben-
eﬁt from LMs being able to access APIs that
read or modify state. In this work, we present
Tool Augmented Language Models (TALM),
combining a text-only approach to augment
language models with non-differentiable tools,
and an iterative “self-play” technique to boot-
strap performance starting from few tool
demonstrations. TALM exhibits strong per-
formance on both a knowledge-heavy QA task
and a reasoning oriented math task with sim-
ple tools. At a given model scale, TALM sig-
niﬁcantly outperforms non-augmented LMs.
We further demonstrate that TALM success-
fully performs out-of-distribution inferences
on both QA and math tasks, where non-
augmented LMs fail. Our results suggest
that Tool Augmented Language Models are a
promising direction to enrich LMs’ capabili-
ties, with less dependence on scale.
1 Introduction
Language models using the Transformer architec-
ture [Vaswani et al., 2017] demonstrate increas-
ing performance at larger scales, e.g. T5 [Raf-
fel et al., 2019], GPT-3 [Brown et al., 2020], and
PaLM [Chowdhery et al., 2022]. Scale related per-
formance gains are observed on a variety of bench-
marks, e.g. SuperGLUE [Wang et al., 2019] and
BIG-bench [BIG-bench collaboration, 2021].
Scaling up has practical downsides. Large scale
models are unwieldy to store, transfer, and deploy.
Their costs to train or perform inference can be
prohibitively high for many researchers and orga-
nizations.

Larger models memorize more world knowl-
edge [Roberts et al., 2020]. While good for many
benchmark tasks, relying on memorization alone
poses several problems. First, models sometimes
generate incorrect outputs that are problematic for
some applications. Second, world knowledge is
constantly changing. The knowledge from yester-
day’s training data might be invalid today. Third,
large models can memorize parts of their training
data with undesirable consequences [Carlini et al.,
2022].
Retrieval based approaches to enhancing LMs
can lower the dependence on scale. REALM [Guu
et al., 2020] learns retrieval via backpropagation
from a ﬁxed corpus. RETRO [Borgeaud et al.,
2021] adds an ”internet scale” retrieval mecha-
nism. RAG [Lewis et al., 2020] uses a dense vec-
tor index of Wikipedia, and retrieves either once
per token or once per query. Other works demon-
strated that LMs can be enhanced on math reason-
ing with access to a calculator [Andor et al., 2019].
Looking towards the future utility of language
models, it is clear that scale and retrieval cannot
solve all useful problems. Many knowledge tasks
and desirable applications require access to read
live or private data (e.g. weather or a person’s cal-arXiv:2205.12255v1  [cs.CL]  24 May 2022endar), or to invoke APIs that modify state. Recent
works such as Say Can [Ahn et al., 2022] connect
languages models to an environment, though with
the model as a recipient of queries. In contrast,
TALM’s approach enables models to invoke arbi-
trary tools with model-generated output, and to at-
tend to tool output to generate task outputs.
In summary, our contributions are:
• Demonstrating that language models can be
augmented with tools via a text-to-text API.
• Demonstrating an iterative self-play tech-
nique to bootstrap tool-augmented datasets
and subsequent tool-augmented model per-
formance, from few la...

INFO:root:The paper titled "TALM: Tool Augmented Language Models" by Aaron Parisi, Yao Zhao, and Noah Fiedel, published in 2022, presents a novel approach to enhancing language models using non-differentiable tools. The authors introduce Tool Augmented Language Models (TALM), which combine a text-only approach with an iterative "self-play" technique to bootstrap performance starting from a few tool demonstrations.

The paper highlights that while transformer-based language models demonstrate increasing performance with scale across a wide variety of tasks, scale alone cannot enable models to solve tasks that require access to ephemeral, changing, or private data that was unavailable at training time. Many useful tasks may also benefit from language models being able to access APIs that read or modify state.

TALM exhibits strong performance on both a knowledge-heavy QA task and a reasoning-oriented math task with simple tools. At a given model scale, TALM significantly outperforms non-augmented language models. The authors also demonstrate that TALM successfully performs out-of-distribution inferences on both QA and math tasks, where non-augmented language models fail.

The authors conclude that Tool Augmented Language Models are a promising direction to enrich language models' capabilities, with less dependence on scale.

INFO:root:While building Large Language Models (LLMs), several safety measures should be incorporated:

1. **Bias Detection and Correction**: Tools should be designed to scrutinize the model's outputs, identifying and flagging potentially biased content for human review and correction. This helps in reducing the propagation of harmful or misleading information.

2. **Security Against Jailbreak Prompts**: There are harmful versions known as "jailbreak prompts" designed to bypass safety measures in LLMs. Measures should be taken to ensure these prompts do not compromise the model's safety.

3. **Safety Tuning**: Approaches for improving safety in large language models that have been fine-tuned to follow instructions should be investigated. This includes tuning the model to avoid harmful or inappropriate responses.

4. **Data Risks and Security Measures**: Many data risks and security measures must be addressed before any implementation occurs. This includes ensuring the privacy and security of the data used for training the model.

5. **Proactive Safety Measures**: Language model providers must develop their technologies responsibly. This means proactively working to build safer products and accepting a duty of care for how their technologies are used.

6. **Multilingual Safety**: As LLMs are deployed globally, it's important to build multilingual safety benchmarks for LLMs to ensure their safe use across different languages and cultures.

7. **Infrastructure Security**: Large language models like ChatGPT are susceptible to various kinds of attacks against their infrastructure, which can range from exploiting software vulnerabilities to data breaches. Measures should be taken to secure the infrastructure hosting these models.

Remember, the goal is to ensure that the LLMs are safe, fair, and beneficial for all users.
